# Credit Task A

## Tasks
Imagine an n-dimensional world where each individual is represented by an n-dimensional vector (position). There are M of these individuals in the world. Each individual can move in any direction and at any speed. The vector of this motion (velocity) will also be n-dimensional.

Create an application that does the following points at each step of the simulation:
1. Adjusts the velocities of each individual by the same, randomly generated vector.
2. Each individual moves five percent towards one pre-selected individual, e.g. an individual X has a pre-selected target individual Y, and another individual Z has a pre-selected individual W.
3. Each individual moves 10 percent towards one common randomly pre-selected individual. 

## Method of submitting solutions
Your solution should be simple enough and can be written in a single *.cu file. You can use our template project. In that case, send me to my email only the single file.
